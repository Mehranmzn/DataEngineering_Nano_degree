## Project Overview :blue_book:

This repository contains several projects developed to demonstrate key data engineering concepts and Azure technologies. The projects are designed to build expertise in:

- Creating and optimizing data models
- Working with NoSQL databases using Cassandra
- Developing ETL pipelines and workflows using Azure Data Factory
- Analyzing data with Azure Synapse Analytics
- Managing and automating data flows across various Azure services
- SQL-based data manipulation and transformation

### Each project folder contains:

- Project-specific documentation
- Source code
- Configuration files
- Instructions for replicating the environment and workflows

## Skills and Tools :toolbox:

The course and projects helped build skills with the following tools and technologies:

- **Data Modeling**: Database schema design, optimization for analytical or transactional use.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Orchestrating ETL pipelines, automation, and scheduling.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehousing, big data analytics, and querying large datasets.
- **NoSQL Database (Cassandra)**: Working with non-relational databases for scalable data storage.
- **SQL**: Querying, transforming, and managing data.
- **Python**: Writing custom ETL logic, data transformation scripts.
- **Data Flows**: Visual data transformations and data orchestration.

## Usage :wrench:

Each project has its own `README` file with specific instructions on usage, running pipelines, and testing the outcomes.

1. Configure Azure services (e.g., set up Azure Data Factory, Synapse, SQL Database) as described in the project documentation.
2. Run ETL pipelines or scripts, following instructions in each project folder.
3. Monitor results via Azure Portal or relevant tools (e.g., Synapse Studio for data warehousing projects).
